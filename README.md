Every script showing up here meets the following:
- I write the whole piece (some parts may be borrowed from open codes)
- No alternatives could be found (at the time I need the function)
- Useful and elegant (Hope so)

Feel free to share and improve!

## openComplete.sh
The "open" command on OSX is useful, but sometimes it's annoying to enter the APP's full name after the "-a" option. After running this script, your "-a" option is smart to scan the names of apps under /Applications directory, transform them to lower case letters and escape the space for you. Just hit \<tab\> for smart auto-completion after "-a ".
