Every script showing up here qulifies:
- I wrote them from scratch (probably spent quite a time on it)
- I had not find any alternatives by the time I wrote it
- Useful and elegant (Hope so)

Feel free to share and improve!

## openComplete.sh
The "open" command on OSX is useful, but sometimes it's annoying enter
the APP's full name after the "-a" option. After running this script,
your "-a" option is smart to scan the names of apps under /Applications
directory, transform them to lower case letters and escape the space
for you. Just hit <tab> for smart auto-completion after "-a ".
